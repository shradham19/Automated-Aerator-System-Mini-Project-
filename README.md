# Automated-Aerator-System-Mini-Project-
This project presents an IoT-based automated aeration system designed to maintain optimal environmental conditions in aquaculture . It addresses the limitations of traditional manual aeration methods by enabling real-time monitoring and automatic control.
Project Overview
This project involves an IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring and control of pH and temperature levels in aquafarming. It utilizes sensors to monitor the aquatic environment and a microcontroller (Arduino Uno) to control an aerator system, ensuring optimal conditions for aquaculture. The system supports wireless communication for remote monitoring and control, enabling efficient pond maintenance with minimal human intervention.
Features
->Real-time monitoring of temperature and pH levels in the aquatic system.
->Automated aerator control based on predefined thresholds for pH and temperature.
->Remote data monitoring and aerator control through a mobile device or computer.
->Continuous data logging and display for easy tracking of pond conditions.
System Architecture
Aerator Control Module
This module continuously monitors the pH and temperature levels. When any parameter exceeds the preset thresholds, the system automatically turns the aerator ON or OFF to maintain a healthy aquatic environment. The aerator improves oxygen transfer, essential for the metabolic processes of aquatic organisms.
Real-Time Monitoring Module
This module provides real-time data and aerator status updates to the farmer via an Android mobile device or computer. It allows farmers to monitor water conditions and adjust the aerator operation remotely.
